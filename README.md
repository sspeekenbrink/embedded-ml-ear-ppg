# Embedded ML Ear PPG

This repository contains the code related to the 
[End-to-End Embedded Machine Learning for In-Ear PPG Peak Detection](https://repository.tudelft.nl/record/uuid:994a13d2-093c-41b0-84df-c7d254e936c0)
thesis paper.

This work establishes a standardised framework for automatically identifying optimal embedded model architectures\
for in-ear PPG analysis.
